                <em>What is Bookworm club?</em>
            </p>
            <p>= A BookWorm Readers Club is a community of book enthusiasts who come together to read, discuss, and share their thoughts
            on various books. These clubs typically focus on fostering a love for reading, exchanging ideas, and building a literary
            community. Members may read the same book simultaneously and discuss it in meetings, or they may share recommendations
            and insights about different genres and authors. The club can be virtual or in-person, catering to different reading
            preferences and styles.</p>
